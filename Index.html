							<h2>To What Extent Does the Recent Election Reinforce the Issues Brought Up About White Supremacy?</h2>
							<p>In Me and White Supremacy, Layla Saad talks about how white supremacy is still very relevant for everyday people and how it hides in not only overt and obvious acts of racism but also in simple interactions. Her book serves as a guide on how to dismantle racism around you and how to recognize and combat your own racism. It is an unfortunate truth that many people today are still racist and proud of it. As American leaders change, so does how racism is fought and dismantled. While our new president, Trump, has improved people’s lives in some ways, there are also many examples of him being outwardly racist. During a presidential debate, he was quoted saying, “In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs, the people that came in, they’re eating the cats. They’re eating the pets of the people that live there.” While this might be more of an extreme example, Trump serves as a role model and sets a precedent for how people should behave. Comments like this, no matter the intent, allow white supremacy and racism not only to continue but grow. The recent election shows how messages, policies, and hidden biases keep white supremacy in place in America, reinforcing the critical need to take accountability and action. Now, more than ever, Americans need to be reading books like Me and White Supremacy and learning how to create a fair and truly antiracist future.</p>
							<p>Racism is woven into America’s history, slavery, shootings, violence, and “everyday” acts of racism are all part of America. Today, many Americans are still inherently racist, whether that means not hiring someone because of their color, labeling someone as dangerous, or ignoring someone. It is still a widespread problem. This kind of racism continues to shape our modern election process. When examining the racism in America, it is very clear that systemic racism is still prevalent, it has just gotten more subtle. It is the horrifying truth that racism persists in “minute” cultural norms and suppression of a diverse group of voices and opinions. It is no single person or party’s fault that this racism continues, rather, it is a systemic problem. For this kind of deeply rooted issue to truly be solved, everyone must want to and commit to it, and that is incredibly hard. There have been countless examples of influential figures scapegoating people of color and creating an “us vs. them” narrative. It is this type of action that tears people and countries apart. To become a more successful and powerful country, America must unify not around racism but around healing and strengthening our society as a whole. Subtle acts of racism easily shift the public perspective to normalize or even idolize it. Donald Trump, in his first eight days back, has made executive orders deporting people, closing borders, and not offering birthright citizenship. These actions will break out people, not help them.
</p>
							<p>In White Supremacy and Me, it reads, “​​People often think that white supremacy is a term that is only used to describe far-right extremists and neo-Nazis. However, this idea that white supremacy only applies to the so-called “bad ones” is both incorrect, and dangerous, because it reinforces the idea that white supremacy is an ideology that is only upheld by a fringe group of white people.” This points again to the idea that it needs to be a conscious action to break down the system of white supremacy, and no one can truly be a “good one” until racism no longer exists. Dismantling white supremacy calls for individual and collective action, and, as Saad warns, it will be hard and painful. White supremacist ideas have been subtly integrated into social norms and structures, and racism has become “ok” or even “funny.” To combat this, people have made up this idea of “woke.” It is so hard to find the balance between being racist and extreme left and “not able to say anything” or “everyone is offended.” While, obviously, most people are in the middle, it is the people on either side who help this problem perpetuate, and this makes it hard for the more reasonable or average person to speak up and make a difference. This isn’t to say that you shouldn't try, destroying white supremacy needs to be something everyone takes accountability for and action toward. When political figures, media outlets, or even people in your community avoid conversations about race, they are unintentionally perpetuating harmful stereotypes and, in some cases, even undermining work done to dismantle racism. Saad spends a lot of time in her book explaining why it is crucial to have these conversations and dig deep into these ideas. 
</p>
							<p>American elections often serve as a mirror as we elect representatives who align with our hopes, ideas, and ideals, but also our biases. Leaders, whether Democrat or Republican, the pervasive effects of racial inequality speak through campaigns, policy platforms, and online narratives. Leaders, in the past, have been known to create policies that continue to marginalize or even silence people. At the same time, with new platforms like social media, more and more people can fight back and speak up, creating the movements and social reform we need. To this day, many people try to ignore racism, but it is the people who stay quiet that become almost accomplices, allowing the evil to continue. Saad writes, “That racism will go away not through awakening consciousness of privilege and racial harm, not through systemic and institutional change, not through addressing imbalances in power, not through making amends for historical and current-day harm, but instead by simply acting as if the social construct of race has no actual consequences—both for those with white privilege and those without it. The belief is that if you act as if you do not see color, you will not do anything racist or benefit from racism.” This “colorblind” approach not only overlooks the lived realities of marginalized groups but also ignores and rebates the systemic nature of white supremacy in America. White supremacy thrives on people insisting it doesn't exist, “small” acts of racism, and ignoring how it forms and affects our society. By refusing to confront these truths head-on, we allow these biases and precedents set by political and other leaders to stay in place; we must instead follow and abide by the lessons that Saad and other authors teach. 
</p>
							<p>Ultimately, the extent to which the recent election reinforces the issues raised in Me and White Supremacy lies in how effectively we examine and dismantle the racial frameworks that shape campaigns, policies, and everyday life. The recent election brought some biases that America has to light and the need we have to stop idolizing those who are racist and focus on our own journey of dismantling racism. Americans, no matter who they are, are becoming more compelled to confront white supremacy in their own lives in small ways, as well as talking out against it. We live in a culture where you can get “canceled” or retaliated against for saying what you believe in, yet people are still voicing their thoughts and helping to dismantle white supremacy. When society continues to reward politicians who use racially charged language and discriminate through policy, it legitimizes the structures Saad’s work calls us to tear down. Yet every act of solidarity, every vote cast for equitable governance, and every push for accountability represents a step toward a future where white supremacy no longer dictates the nation’s moral and political compass. The recent election reinforced the importance and validity of Saad’s book, saying that true change must stem from the individual and, though hard, must be done. Americans of all ethnicities and backgrounds must recognize their privilege and the impact they can have. It is hard to unlearn biases, but holding leaders accountable so that the pillars of white supremacy crumble is what needs to happen. It is harder to live in a deeply racist world and not do anything. Racism and white supremacy will always be a horrific part of our past, but it doesn’t need to be in our future. Right now, it seems so deeply ingrained and normalized that it feels impossible to end. Books like Me and White Supremacy offer the guidance that we need to take down the system of white supremacy brick by brick.

							<h2>To What Extent Does the Recent Election Reinforce the Issues Brought Up About White Supremacy?</h2>
							<p>In Me and White Supremacy, Layla Saad talks about how white supremacy is still very relevant for everyday people and how it hides in not only overt and obvious acts of racism but also in simple interactions. Her book serves as a guide on how to dismantle racism around you and how to recognize and combat your own racism. It is an unfortunate truth that many people today are still racist and proud of it. As American leaders change, so does how racism is fought and dismantled. While our new president, Trump, has improved people’s lives in some ways, there are also many examples of him being outwardly racist. During a presidential debate, he was quoted saying, “In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs, the people that came in, they’re eating the cats. They’re eating the pets of the people that live there.” While this might be more of an extreme example, Trump serves as a role model and sets a precedent for how people should behave. Comments like this, no matter the intent, allow white supremacy and racism not only to continue but grow. The recent election shows how messages, policies, and hidden biases keep white supremacy in place in America, reinforcing the critical need to take accountability and action. Now, more than ever, Americans need to be reading books like Me and White Supremacy and learning how to create a fair and truly antiracist future.</p>
							<p>Racism is woven into America’s history, slavery, shootings, violence, and “everyday” acts of racism are all part of America. Today, many Americans are still inherently racist, whether that means not hiring someone because of their color, labeling someone as dangerous, or ignoring someone. It is still a widespread problem. This kind of racism continues to shape our modern election process. When examining the racism in America, it is very clear that systemic racism is still prevalent, it has just gotten more subtle. It is the horrifying truth that racism persists in “minute” cultural norms and suppression of a diverse group of voices and opinions. It is no single person or party’s fault that this racism continues, rather, it is a systemic problem. For this kind of deeply rooted issue to truly be solved, everyone must want to and commit to it, and that is incredibly hard. There have been countless examples of influential figures scapegoating people of color and creating an “us vs. them” narrative. It is this type of action that tears people and countries apart. To become a more successful and powerful country, America must unify not around racism but around healing and strengthening our society as a whole. Subtle acts of racism easily shift the public perspective to normalize or even idolize it. Donald Trump, in his first eight days back, has made executive orders deporting people, closing borders, and not offering birthright citizenship. These actions will break out people, not help them.
</p>
							<p>In White Supremacy and Me, it reads, “​​People often think that white supremacy is a term that is only used to describe far-right extremists and neo-Nazis. However, this idea that white supremacy only applies to the so-called “bad ones” is both incorrect, and dangerous, because it reinforces the idea that white supremacy is an ideology that is only upheld by a fringe group of white people.” This points again to the idea that it needs to be a conscious action to break down the system of white supremacy, and no one can truly be a “good one” until racism no longer exists. Dismantling white supremacy calls for individual and collective action, and, as Saad warns, it will be hard and painful. White supremacist ideas have been subtly integrated into social norms and structures, and racism has become “ok” or even “funny.” To combat this, people have made up this idea of “woke.” It is so hard to find the balance between being racist and extreme left and “not able to say anything” or “everyone is offended.” While, obviously, most people are in the middle, it is the people on either side who help this problem perpetuate, and this makes it hard for the more reasonable or average person to speak up and make a difference. This isn’t to say that you shouldn't try, destroying white supremacy needs to be something everyone takes accountability for and action toward. When political figures, media outlets, or even people in your community avoid conversations about race, they are unintentionally perpetuating harmful stereotypes and, in some cases, even undermining work done to dismantle racism. Saad spends a lot of time in her book explaining why it is crucial to have these conversations and dig deep into these ideas. 
</p>
							<p>American elections often serve as a mirror as we elect representatives who align with our hopes, ideas, and ideals, but also our biases. Leaders, whether Democrat or Republican, the pervasive effects of racial inequality speak through campaigns, policy platforms, and online narratives. Leaders, in the past, have been known to create policies that continue to marginalize or even silence people. At the same time, with new platforms like social media, more and more people can fight back and speak up, creating the movements and social reform we need. To this day, many people try to ignore racism, but it is the people who stay quiet that become almost accomplices, allowing the evil to continue. Saad writes, “That racism will go away not through awakening consciousness of privilege and racial harm, not through systemic and institutional change, not through addressing imbalances in power, not through making amends for historical and current-day harm, but instead by simply acting as if the social construct of race has no actual consequences—both for those with white privilege and those without it. The belief is that if you act as if you do not see color, you will not do anything racist or benefit from racism.” This “colorblind” approach not only overlooks the lived realities of marginalized groups but also ignores and rebates the systemic nature of white supremacy in America. White supremacy thrives on people insisting it doesn't exist, “small” acts of racism, and ignoring how it forms and affects our society. By refusing to confront these truths head-on, we allow these biases and precedents set by political and other leaders to stay in place; we must instead follow and abide by the lessons that Saad and other authors teach. 
</p>
							<p>Ultimately, the extent to which the recent election reinforces the issues raised in Me and White Supremacy lies in how effectively we examine and dismantle the racial frameworks that shape campaigns, policies, and everyday life. The recent election brought some biases that America has to light and the need we have to stop idolizing those who are racist and focus on our own journey of dismantling racism. Americans, no matter who they are, are becoming more compelled to confront white supremacy in their own lives in small ways, as well as talking out against it. We live in a culture where you can get “canceled” or retaliated against for saying what you believe in, yet people are still voicing their thoughts and helping to dismantle white supremacy. When society continues to reward politicians who use racially charged language and discriminate through policy, it legitimizes the structures Saad’s work calls us to tear down. Yet every act of solidarity, every vote cast for equitable governance, and every push for accountability represents a step toward a future where white supremacy no longer dictates the nation’s moral and political compass. The recent election reinforced the importance and validity of Saad’s book, saying that true change must stem from the individual and, though hard, must be done. Americans of all ethnicities and backgrounds must recognize their privilege and the impact they can have. It is hard to unlearn biases, but holding leaders accountable so that the pillars of white supremacy crumble is what needs to happen. It is harder to live in a deeply racist world and not do anything. Racism and white supremacy will always be a horrific part of our past, but it doesn’t need to be in our future. Right now, it seems so deeply ingrained and normalized that it feels impossible to end. Books like Me and White Supremacy offer the guidance that we need to take down the system of white supremacy brick by brick.
